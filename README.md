# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The motivation and reasoning for this project was to apply and reinforce the skills/languages learned in this module by creating something that can be of use to others. I learned the overall functions of the languages of html, css, and javascript in programming.
